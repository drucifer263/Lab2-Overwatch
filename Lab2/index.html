                            Overwatch features a number of different game modes, principally designed around squad-based combat with two opposing teams of six players each. Players select one of over
                            two dozen pre-made hero characters from one of three class types: Damage heroes that deal most of the damage to attack or defend control points, Tank heroes that can absorb a
                            large amount of damage, and Support heroes that provide healing or other buffs for their teammates.Each hero has a unique skill kit, defining their intrinsic attributes like
                            health points and running speed, their primary attacks, several active and passive skills, and an ultimate ability that can only be used after it has been charged through dealing
                            damage. Players can change their hero during the course of a match, as a goal of Overwatch's design was to encourage dynamic team compositions that adapt to the situation.
                            The game's genre has been described by some journalists as a "hero shooter", due to its design around specific heroes and classes. The game features game modes for casual play,
                            competitive ranked play, and for supporting esports competitions including Blizzard's Overwatch League. These modes generally are centered around sequentially securing control of
                            points on the map, or escorting a payload between points on the map, with one team attacking while the other defends. Other modes set aside for casual matches include solo and team
                            deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and unique modes run during various seasonal events. Regardless of winning or losing a match, players gain experience towards a player level, and on
                            gaining a new level, receive loot boxes that contain cosmetic items that they can use to customize the appearance of the hero characters but otherwise does not affect gameplay. Loot
                            boxes can also be purchased through microtransactions. <cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)</cite>

                            Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, thirty years after the resolution of the "Omnic Crisis". Prior to the Omnic Crisis, humanity had been
                            in a golden age of prosperity and technology development. Humans developed robots with artificial intelligence called "Omnics", which were produced worldwide in automated "omnium"
                            facilities and put to use to achieve economic equality, and began to be treated as people in their own right. The Omnic Crisis began when the omniums started producing a series
                            of lethal, hostile robots, which turned against humankind. The United Nations quickly formed Overwatch, an international task force to combat the omnic threat and restore order.
                            Two veteran soldiers were put in charge of Overwatch: Gabriel Reyes and Jack Morrison. Though Overwatch successfully quelled the robotic uprising and brought a number of talented
                            individuals to the forefront, a rift ended up developing between Reyes and Morrison, and Morrison became the leader of Overwatch while Reyes took charge of Blackwatch, Overwatch's
                            covert operations division. Overwatch maintained peace across the world for several decades in what was called the "Overwatch Generation" as the team gained more members, but the
                            rift between Morrison and Reyes intensified. Several allegations of wrongdoing and failures were leveled at Overwatch, leading to a public outcry against the organization and in-fighting
                            between its members, prompting the UN to investigate the situation. During this, an explosion destroyed Overwatch's headquarters in Switzerland, purportedly killing Morrison and Reyes
                            among others. The UN passed the Petras Act, which dismantled Overwatch and forbade any Overwatch-type activity. Overwatch is set six years after the Petras Act; without Overwatch,
                            corporations have started to take over, fighting and terrorism have broken out in parts of the globe, and there are signs of a second Omnic Crisis occurring in Russia. A former
                            member of Overwatch, the intelligent gorilla Winston, decides to begin reforming Overwatch to protect the peace once again despite the Petras Act, with the team members recruiting
                            old friends and gaining new allies in their fight.[8] Thus it is also revealed that Reyes and Morrison were not killed in the explosion, that, in fact, was the result of a battle
                            between them: Morrison became a masked vigilante known as "Soldier: 76", who is trying to uncover the reasons why Overwatch was shut down; while Reyes joined the criminal organisation
                            Talon and became "Reaper", a terrorist disguised as Death.<cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overwatch_(video_game)</cite>

                            There are currently 28 playable hero characters in Overwatch. Each hero offers a unique style of play, and are generally classified under one of three roles: tank, damage, and support.
                            In a standard game (i.e. quick play or competitive), players can switch between heroes during a game, though each team can not have more than one of the same hero at one time. Some Arcade
                            game modes allow different rules to what heroes can be played. No Limits allows players to stack the same character multiple times on one team, while in Mystery Heroes, the game randomly
                            picks the hero for which the player must play, making it possible that the same hero will be picked for two or more players.Heroes come from a variety of national/ethnic backgrounds, and
                            occasionally speak in their native languages during matches.<cite>https://overwatch.gamepedia.com/Heroes</cite>

                            There are 4 different kinds of maps.Overwatch was released with 12 maps, but new maps have been added over time. Like new heroes, these maps are usually introduced first within the Public 
                            Test Server (PTS) region, allowing players to opt-in to help test and provide feedback on the maps. Once Blizzard feels the map is ready, it is then added to all gameplay regions, entering 
                            into normal casual map rotation and often featured in a special Arcade mode for a week or so. New maps are not introduced immediately into competitive mode; though Blizzard had previously 
                            waited until the completion of a competitive mode season to introduce a map, as of May 2018 they now plan to add new maps into the competitive mode rotation two weeks following their global 
                            introduction into casual play.[19]The maps are typically designed to support portions of the Overwatch narrative, which follows from thirty years after a robotic uprising, the Omnic Crisis, 
                            occurred in Earth's near future. The crisis was resolved by the Overwatch agency, but which afterward was disbanded. In the game's present, with a threat of another Omnic Crisis and appearance 
                            of several shadowy groups, the members of Overwatch have rejoined forces. Most of the game's maps are inspired by real-world locations.[20] the first four maps, "King's Row", "Hanamura", "Temple 
                            of Anubis", and "Ilios" are inspired by London, Japan, the ruins of Ancient Egypt, and Greece respectively.[5] During seasonal events, certain maps may be redecorated for the event's theme, but 
                            otherwise retain the fundamental layouts, such as Halloween updates for the Hollywood and Eichenwald maps during the "Halloween Terror" events.<cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gameplay_of_Overwatch</cite>
